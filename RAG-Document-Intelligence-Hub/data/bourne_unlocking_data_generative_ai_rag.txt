CHAPTER 1: THE GENERATIVE AI REVOLUTION

Introduction to Generative AI

Generative AI represents a paradigm shift in how we interact with data and knowledge. Unlike discriminative models that classify or predict, generative models create new content: text, code, images, audio, and video.

Key Capabilities:
- Natural language understanding and generation
- Code synthesis and completion
- Document summarization
- Question answering
- Content creation and editing
- Language translation

Large Language Models (LLMs):

Foundation Models:
- GPT-4 (OpenAI)
- Claude (Anthropic)
- PaLM 2 (Google)
- LLaMA 2 (Meta)
- Mistral (Mistral AI)

Characteristics:
- Billions of parameters
- Trained on massive text corpora
- Transfer learning capabilities
- Few-shot and zero-shot learning
- Emergent abilities at scale

How LLMs Work:

Architecture:
- Transformer-based neural networks
- Self-attention mechanisms
- Positional encoding
- Layer normalization
- Feed-forward networks

Training Process:
1. Pre-training on large text corpus
   - Next token prediction
   - Masked language modeling
   - Unsupervised learning

2. Fine-tuning for specific tasks
   - Supervised learning
   - Instruction tuning
   - RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

Token Generation:
- Autoregressive generation
- Sampling strategies (temperature, top-k, top-p)
- Beam search
- Constraint decoding

Limitations of Pure LLMs:

1. Knowledge Cutoff
   - Training data has a date limit
   - No knowledge of recent events
   - Can't access proprietary information

2. Hallucinations
   - Generate plausible but incorrect information
   - Confident in false statements
   - Lack of source attribution

3. Context Window Limits
   - Limited input size (4K-128K tokens)
   - Can't process entire databases
   - Information loss with long contexts

4. No Real-Time Data Access
   - Static knowledge
   - Can't query databases
   - No API access

5. Domain-Specific Knowledge Gaps
   - Generic training data
   - Limited specialized expertise
   - No company-specific knowledge

Enter Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

RAG addresses LLM limitations by combining:
- Information retrieval systems
- Large language models
- Domain-specific knowledge bases

Benefits:
✓ Access to current information
✓ Grounded in factual sources
✓ Reduced hallucinations
✓ Scalable to large knowledge bases
✓ Updateable without retraining
✓ Source attribution

CHAPTER 2: RAG ARCHITECTURE FUNDAMENTALS

Core Components of RAG Systems

1. Document Processing Pipeline

Ingestion:
- Load documents from various sources
- Handle multiple formats (PDF, Word, HTML, Markdown)
- Extract text and metadata
- Maintain document provenance

Chunking:
- Split documents into manageable pieces
- Preserve semantic coherence
- Balance chunk size (200-1000 tokens)
- Consider overlap for context preservation

Strategies:
- Fixed-size chunking
- Sentence-based splitting
- Paragraph-based splitting
- Semantic chunking
- Recursive splitting

Example Chunking Code:
```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=800,
    chunk_overlap=100,
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""]
)

chunks = splitter.split_text(document_text)
```

2. Embedding Generation

What are Embeddings?
- Dense vector representations
- Capture semantic meaning
- Typically 768-1536 dimensions
- Enable similarity search

Popular Embedding Models:
- OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
- Sentence-BERT
- Instructor embeddings
- BGE (BAAI General Embedding)
- E5 embeddings

Properties:
- Similar texts → similar vectors
- Cosine similarity for comparison
- Semantic search capability
- Language-agnostic (multilingual models)

Example Embedding:
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-ada-002",
    input="Data engineering best practices"
)

embedding = response.data[0].embedding  # 1536-dim vector
```

3. Vector Database

Purpose:
- Store embeddings efficiently
- Enable fast similarity search
- Scale to millions of vectors
- Support metadata filtering

Popular Vector Databases:
- Pinecone (managed, cloud)
- Weaviate (open-source)
- Qdrant (open-source, Rust)
- Milvus (open-source, scalable)
- ChromaDB (open-source, simple)
- FAISS (Facebook, library)

Key Features:
- Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- Filtering and metadata
- Persistence
- API access

ChromaDB Example:
```python
import chromadb

client = chromadb.Client()
collection = client.create_collection("documents")

# Add documents
collection.add(
    documents=chunks,
    embeddings=embeddings,
    metadatas=[{"source": "doc1.pdf", "page": 1}],
    ids=[f"chunk_{i}" for i in range(len(chunks))]
)

# Query
results = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=query_embedding,
    n_results=5
)
```

4. Retrieval Component

Retrieval Process:
1. Convert user query to embedding
2. Compute similarity with stored vectors
3. Retrieve top-k most similar chunks
4. Apply optional reranking
5. Return relevant context

Similarity Metrics:
- Cosine similarity (most common)
- Euclidean distance
- Dot product
- Manhattan distance

Retrieval Strategies:

Dense Retrieval:
- Semantic vector search
- Captures meaning
- Good for conceptual queries
- Requires embeddings

Sparse Retrieval:
- Keyword-based (BM25, TF-IDF)
- Exact term matching
- Good for specific terms
- Traditional IR

Hybrid Retrieval:
- Combine dense + sparse
- Best of both worlds
- Rerank results
- Improved relevance

5. Generation Component

Prompt Construction:

Template:
```
Context: {retrieved_documents}

Question: {user_question}

Please answer the question based on the provided context. 
If the answer is not in the context, say "I don't have enough information."
```

Advanced Prompting:
- Few-shot examples
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Structured output formats
- Citations and sources

LLM Integration:
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {question}"}
    ],
    temperature=0.3
)

answer = response.choices[0].message.content
```

CHAPTER 3: ADVANCED RAG TECHNIQUES

Improving Retrieval Quality

1. Query Transformation

Query Rewriting:
- Rephrase ambiguous queries
- Expand acronyms
- Add context
- Multiple query variations

Example:
```python
def expand_query(query, llm):
    prompt = f"""
    Rewrite this query in 3 different ways to improve search:
    Original: {query}
    
    Provide variations that capture different aspects.
    """
    return llm.generate(prompt)
```

HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings):
- Generate hypothetical answer
- Embed the answer
- Search using answer embedding
- Better semantic matching

Step-Back Prompting:
- Ask broader question first
- Retrieve general context
- Then answer specific question

2. Reranking

Why Rerank?
- Initial retrieval may miss nuances
- Consider query-document interaction
- Cross-encoders more accurate than bi-encoders
- Computational trade-off

Cross-Encoder Reranking:
```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

reranker = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')

# Score each document
scores = reranker.predict([
    (query, doc) for doc in retrieved_docs
])

# Sort by score
ranked_docs = [doc for _, doc in sorted(
    zip(scores, retrieved_docs), 
    reverse=True
)][:top_k]
```

LLM-based Reranking:
- Use LLM to judge relevance
- More expensive but accurate
- Can provide explanations

3. Multi-Query Retrieval

Generate multiple queries:
- Different phrasings
- Decompose complex questions
- Parallel retrieval
- Combine results

RAG Fusion:
1. Generate multiple query variations
2. Retrieve for each query
3. Reciprocal rank fusion
4. Return merged results

4. Contextual Compression

Problem: Retrieving full chunks wastes context window

Solution: Extract only relevant sentences

```python
from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainExtractor

compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm)
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
    base_compressor=compressor,
    base_retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever()
)

compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
```

5. Parent Document Retrieval

Strategy:
- Store embeddings for small chunks (better retrieval)
- Return full parent documents (better context)
- Best of both worlds

Implementation:
- Chunk documents hierarchically
- Embed leaf nodes
- Store parent references
- Retrieve parents of matched leaves

Handling Multi-Modal Data

Beyond Text:

Images:
- CLIP embeddings
- Vision-language models
- Image-to-text search
- Visual question answering

Tables:
- Table parsing
- Structured data extraction
- Table-to-text conversion

{content}
```

Agentic RAG

Multi-Step Reasoning:
1. Decompose question into sub-questions
2. Retrieve for each sub-question
3. Synthesize intermediate answers
4. Combine for final answer

Tool Use:
- RAG retrieval as one tool
- Calculator for math
- Web search for current events
- Database queries for structured data

ReAct Pattern (Reasoning + Acting):
```
Thought: I need to find X
Action: search("X")
Observation: [results]
Thought: Now I need Y
Action: search("Y")
Observation: [results]
Thought: I have enough information
Answer: [final answer]
```

Self-Reflection:
- Generate initial answer
- Critique and verify
- Retrieve additional context
- Refine answer
