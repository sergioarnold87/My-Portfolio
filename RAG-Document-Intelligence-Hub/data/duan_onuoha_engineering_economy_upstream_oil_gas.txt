- Commerciality assessment

Development:
- Field development planning
- Infrastructure design
- Production facilities
- Drilling programs
- Longest lead time activity

Production:
- Well operations
- Facility maintenance
- Enhanced oil recovery
- Decline curve management
- Asset optimization

Types of Hydrocarbon Resources:

Conventional Resources:
- Easy to extract
- Good reservoir quality
- Primary/secondary recovery
- Lower breakeven costs
- Mature technologies

Unconventional Resources:
- Shale oil and gas
- Tight formations
- Coal bed methane
- Oil sands
- Higher technical complexity
- Hydraulic fracturing required

Reserve Classifications (SPE-PRMS):

Proved Reserves (1P):
- 90% probability (P90)
- Developed producing
- Developed non-producing
- Undeveloped
- Bankable reserves

Proved + Probable (2P):
- 50% probability (P50)
- Best estimate
- Planning basis
- 2P - 1P = Probable

Proved + Probable + Possible (3P):
- 10% probability (P10)
- Upside scenario
- Resource potential

Contingent Resources:
- Not yet commercial
- Technical feasibility demonstrated
- Awaiting economic conditions
- Regulatory approval pending

Prospective Resources:
- Potential accumulations
- Not yet discovered
- Exploration targets
- High risk

Economic Framework:

Time Value of Money:
```
Present Value (PV) = FV / (1 + r)^n

where:
FV = Future Value
r = Discount rate
n = Number of periods
```

Net Present Value (NPV):
```
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow_t / (1 + r)^t] - Initial Investment

Decision rule:
NPV > 0: Accept project
NPV < 0: Reject project
```

Internal Rate of Return (IRR):
```
0 = Σ [Cash Flow_t / (1 + IRR)^t] - Initial Investment

IRR = Discount rate where NPV = 0

Decision rule:
IRR > Required return: Accept
IRR < Required return: Reject
```

Payback Period:
```
Time to recover initial investment

Simple Payback: Ignores time value
Discounted Payback: Accounts for time value

Shorter payback = Lower risk
```

Key Cost Categories:

Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):
- Exploration costs
- Development drilling
- Facilities and infrastructure
- Abandonment provisions
- Large upfront investment

Operating Expenditure (OPEX):
- Production operations
- Maintenance
- Utilities
- Personnel
- Ongoing costs

Fiscal Terms:
- Royalties (% of production)
- Production taxes
- Corporate income tax
- Ring-fencing provisions
- Government take

CHAPTER 2: PROJECT ECONOMICS EVALUATION

Cash Flow Analysis

Revenue Estimation:

Production Profile:
```
Annual Production = Initial Rate * Decline Factor^t

Exponential Decline:
Q(t) = Q_i * e^(-D*t)

Hyperbolic Decline:
Q(t) = Q_i / (1 + b*D*t)^(1/b)

where:
Q_i = Initial production rate
D = Decline rate
b = Hyperbolic constant
t = Time
```

Price Assumptions:
- Flat price (conservative)
- Escalated price (inflation-adjusted)
- Forward curve (market-based)
- Scenario analysis (high/low/mid)

Revenue Calculation:
```
Revenue = Production * Price * Quality Adjustment

Quality factors:
- API gravity premium/discount
- Sulfur content discount
- Transportation to market
- Netback pricing
```

```
Project: Onshore oil field
Initial Investment: $200M
Production: 10,000 bopd declining 15%/year
Oil Price: $70/bbl
OPEX: $10/bbl
Royalty: 12.5%
Tax rate: 30%
Discount rate: 10%

Year 1 Cash Flow:
Revenue: 10,000 * 365 * $70 = $255.5M
Royalty: $255.5M * 12.5% = $32M
OPEX: 10,000 * 365 * $10 = $36.5M
Taxable Income: $255.5M - $32M - $36.5M - Depreciation
After-tax Cash Flow = ...
```

Discount Rate Selection:

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):
```
WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1-Tc))

where:
E = Market value of equity
D = Market value of debt
V = E + D
Re = Cost of equity
Rd = Cost of debt
Tc = Corporate tax rate
```

Risk-Adjusted Rates:
- Exploration: 20-30%
- Appraisal: 15-20%
- Development: 10-15%
- Production: 8-12%
- Enhanced recovery: 12-18%

Country Risk Premium:
```
Discount Rate = Risk-free rate + Equity risk premium + Country risk

Examples:
US onshore: 10%
North Sea: 12%

Frontier areas: 25%+
```

Sensitivity Analysis:

Key Variables:
1. Oil/Gas Price (±20%)

    volume = random.triangular(low=P90, mode=P50, high=P10)
    capex = random.uniform(low_estimate, high_estimate)
    
    npv = calculate_npv(price, volume, capex)
    npv_distribution.append(npv)

P10_NPV = percentile(npv_distribution, 10)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CHAPTER 3: FISCAL SYSTEMS AND CONTRACTS

Types of Fiscal Regimes:

Royalty/Tax System (R/T):

Structure:
- Host government owns resources
- Company pays royalty (% of production)
- Plus income tax on profits
- Common in OECD countries

Cash Flow Split:
```
Gross Revenue: 100%
- Royalty: 12.5-20%
- OPEX: Variable
- Depreciation: Capital recovery
= Taxable Income
- Income Tax: 25-40%
= Company Net Cash Flow: 40-60%
```

Examples:
- United States (onshore)
- Canada (Alberta)
- Australia
- United Kingdom

Production Sharing Contract (PSC):

Structure:
- Government owns resources
- Company recovers costs from "cost oil"
- Remaining "profit oil" split per contract
- No/low income tax

Cash Flow Waterfall:
```
Gross Production: 100%
- Royalty: 0-15%
= Available for split
- Cost Oil: 40-80% (cap)
  → Company recovers CAPEX + OPEX
= Profit Oil: Remaining
  → Split per PSC (Company: 20-60%, Gov: 40-80%)
+ Cost Oil
= Company Share
```

Examples:
- Indonesia
- Malaysia
- Angola
- Nigeria

Service Contract:

Structure:
- Government owns resources and production
- Company paid service fee
- Fixed fee or % of production
- Low risk, low reward

Types:
- Pure Service: Fixed $/bbl fee
- Risk Service: Fee contingent on success
- Enhanced: Performance bonuses

Examples:
- Mexico (pre-reform)
- Iran
- Kuwait
- Saudi Arabia (historically)

Concessionary System:

Structure:
- Company owns produced hydrocarbons
- Government receives royalty + taxes
- Full upstream control
- Traditional system

Characteristics:
- Long-term licenses
- Exploration commitments
- Relinquishment obligations
- Decommissioning responsibility

Government Take Analysis:

Calculation:
```
Government Take = (Gov Revenue) / (Total Project Revenue)

Gov Revenue = Royalties + Taxes + Bonuses + Gov Profit Oil

Total Revenue = Gross Revenue from production

Typical ranges:
US onshore: 40-50%
North Sea: 60-70%
Middle East PSC: 80-90%
Service contracts: 85-95%
```

Progressivity:

Regressive Systems:
- Fixed royalty rate
- Flat tax rate
- Gov take decreases with price increase

Progressive Systems:
- Sliding scale royalties
- Supplementary taxes
- R-factor mechanisms
- Gov take increases with profitability

R-Factor:
```
R-Factor = Cumulative Revenue / Cumulative Costs

Triggers higher government take at R > thresholds

Example:
R < 1.5: Company 40% profit oil
R = 1.5-2.0: Company 30%
R > 2.0: Company 20%
```

Fiscal Stability:

Stabilization Clauses:
- Freeze fiscal terms
- Protect against adverse changes
- Limited duration (10-20 years)
- Renegotiation triggers

Economic Equilibrium:
- Price reopeners
- Hardship clauses
- Windfall taxes
- Balance of risk/reward

Contract Negotiation:

Company Objectives:
- Maximize NPV and IRR
- Minimize government take
- Ensure cost recovery
- Operational control
- Fiscal stability

Government Objectives:

Valuation Methods:

Black-Scholes Adaptation:
```
Call Option Value = S*N(d1) - K*e^(-r*T)*N(d2)

where:
S = PV of expected cash flows
K = Investment cost
r = Risk-free rate
T = Time to expiration
σ = Volatility

d1 = [ln(S/K) + (r + σ²/2)*T] / (σ*√T)
d2 = d1 - σ*√T
```

Binomial Trees:
- Discrete time steps
- Up/down price movements
- Work backward from decision points

Decision Trees:

Structure:
- Decision nodes (squares)
- Chance nodes (circles)
- Terminal nodes (triangles)

Expected Monetary Value (EMV):
```
EMV = Σ (Probability * Outcome)

Example:
Explore: 
  Success (30%): $500M
  Failure (70%): -$50M
EMV = 0.30*$500M + 0.70*(-$50M) = $115M

Compare to alternative (e.g., farm-out)
```

Sequential Decisions:
```
Stage 1: Explore
  → Success: Stage 2 Appraise
    → Commercial: Stage 3 Develop
    → Non-commercial: Abandon
  → Failure: Abandon

Roll back method:
Start at end, calculate EMV backward
```

Must justify:
- Additional CAPEX
- Higher OPEX
- Extended field life
- Vs incremental oil recovery
```

Timing Optimization:
- Early EOR: Higher recovery potential
- Late EOR: Mature infrastructure
- Trade-off analysis required

Case Study:
```
Field: Mature onshore
Primary recovery: 10% (depleted)
Secondary recovery: 25% (waterflooded)
EOR target: +10% recovery

Incremental reserves: 50 MMbbl
CAPEX: $800M
OPEX: $20/bbl
Oil price: $70/bbl
Discount rate: 12%

Incremental NPV = ?
IRR = ?
Payback = ?
```

Subsea and Deepwater Economics:

Cost Drivers:

Water Depth Impact:
```
Shallow water (<400m): $20-40/bbl reserves
Deepwater (400-1500m): $40-80/bbl
Ultra-deepwater (>1500m): $60-100+/bbl

Exponential cost increase with depth
```

Development Concepts:

Standalone Platform:
- Integrated topsides and hull
- High CAPEX ($2-5B)
- Suitable for large fields
- Hub for future tie-backs

Subsea Tie-Back:
- Wells tied to host facility
- Lower CAPEX ($500M-1.5B)
- Suitable for smaller fields
- Flowline length limited

FPSO (Floating Production):
- Ship-shaped production vessel
- Flexible and movable
- $1-3B depending on capacity
- Suitable for remote locations

Break-Even Analysis:
```
Minimum reserves for standalone: 300-500 MMboe
Tie-back economic: 30-100 MMboe
FPSO threshold: 100-300 MMboe
```

Unconventional Resources:
