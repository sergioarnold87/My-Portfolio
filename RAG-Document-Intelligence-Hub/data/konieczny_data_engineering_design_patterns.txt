DATA ENGINEERING DESIGN PATTERNS
by Konieczny (Technical Reference)

=== INTRODUCTION ===
Modern data engineering requires systematic approaches to building scalable, maintainable data systems. Design patterns provide proven solutions to recurring problems in data pipeline development, storage optimization, and data transformation workflows.

=== CORE PATTERNS ===

1. LAMBDA ARCHITECTURE
The Lambda architecture addresses the challenge of processing both real-time and historical data. It consists of three layers:
- Batch Layer: Processes complete datasets to produce batch views
- Speed Layer: Handles real-time data with lower latency
- Serving Layer: Merges results from both layers for queries

Key Benefits:
- Fault tolerance through immutable data storage
- Scalability for both batch and streaming
- Human fault tolerance with recomputation capabilities

Challenges:
- Complexity of maintaining two separate code paths
- Resource overhead from dual processing
- Eventual consistency between layers

2. KAPPA ARCHITECTURE
A simplified alternative to Lambda, Kappa processes all data as streams:
- Single processing engine for all data
- Events stored in distributed log (e.g., Kafka)
- Reprocessing through log replay

Advantages:
- Reduced operational complexity
- Single codebase for all processing
- Simplified debugging and testing

3. MEDALLION ARCHITECTURE (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
A data lakehouse pattern organizing data by quality level:
- Bronze: Raw ingested data, minimal transformation
- Silver: Cleaned, validated, deduplicated data
- Gold: Business-level aggregates and features

This pattern enables:
- Incremental quality improvement
- Audit trails through preservation of raw data
- Role-based access at different quality levels

4. SLOWLY CHANGING DIMENSIONS (SCD)
Patterns for tracking historical changes in dimensional data:

Type 1 (Overwrite): Replace old values with new
Type 2 (Versioning): Add new rows with version/timestamp
Type 3 (Previous Value): Keep limited history in additional columns

Type 2 is most common in modern data warehouses, enabling:
- Complete historical analysis
- Point-in-time queries
- Regulatory compliance

5. CHANGE DATA CAPTURE (CDC)
Capturing incremental changes from source systems:
- Log-based CDC: Read database transaction logs
- Trigger-based: Database triggers capture changes
- Query-based: Timestamp/version column queries

Benefits:
- Reduced load on source systems
- Near real-time data availability
- Lower bandwidth and storage costs

6. EVENT SOURCING
Store all changes as immutable event sequences:
- Events are append-only
- Current state derived from event replay
- Complete audit trail maintained

Applications:
- Financial transaction systems
- User activity tracking
- System state reconstruction

7. IDEMPOTENT PIPELINES
Design pipelines to produce same results regardless of execution count:
- Use deterministic transformations
- Implement upsert patterns instead of inserts
- Add execution timestamps and run IDs

Critical for:
- Pipeline reliability
- Failure recovery
- Scheduled reprocessing

8. DATA PARTITIONING STRATEGIES
Optimize storage and query performance:
- Time-based: Partition by date/hour for time-series data
- Hash-based: Distribute data evenly across partitions
- Range-based: Group by value ranges
- List-based: Explicit partition assignments

Considerations:
- Query patterns and access frequency
- Data distribution and skew
- Maintenance overhead

9. SCHEMA EVOLUTION PATTERNS
Handle schema changes without breaking pipelines:
- Schema Registry: Central schema versioning
- Forward/Backward Compatibility: Add/remove fields safely
- Schema-on-Read: Defer schema enforcement to read time

Strategies:
- Use nullable fields for new columns
- Maintain schema version metadata
- Implement graceful degradation

10. DATA QUALITY GATES
Implement validation checkpoints in pipelines:
- Schema validation
- Completeness checks (null rates, missing records)
- Freshness verification
- Statistical anomaly detection
- Business rule validation

Pattern implementation:
- Fail fast on critical violations
- Log warnings for minor issues
- Generate data quality metrics
- Alert on threshold breaches

=== ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID ===

1. The God Pipeline: Single monolithic pipeline doing everything
   Solution: Decompose into focused, composable pipelines

2. Hard-coded Configurations: Embedded credentials and parameters
   Solution: Externalize configuration, use secret management

3. Tight Coupling: Direct dependencies between pipeline stages
   Solution: Use message queues and event-driven architecture

4. No Monitoring: Running blind without observability
   Solution: Implement comprehensive logging and metrics

5. Data Duplication: Multiple copies without clear purpose
   Solution: Single source of truth with derived views

=== BEST PRACTICES ===

- Design for failure: Assume components will fail
- Make pipelines idempotent and replayable
- Version all code, configuration, and schemas
- Implement comprehensive testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Document data lineage and dependencies
- Use declarative over imperative approaches when possible
- Optimize for debuggability and observability
- Plan for data retention and archival from day one

=== CONCLUSION ===
Data engineering patterns provide reusable solutions to common challenges. Successful implementations require understanding the trade-offs of each pattern and adapting them to specific organizational needs and constraints.
