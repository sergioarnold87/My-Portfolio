CHAPTER 2: EXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITIES (ETCs)

What Are ETCs?

Exchange-Traded Commodities (ETCs) are securities that track the price of an underlying commodity or commodity index. They trade on stock exchanges like stocks but provide exposure to commodities without physical ownership or futures trading.

Structure:

Debt Securities:
- ETCs are debt notes, not funds
- Issuer promises to pay commodity return
- Credit risk of issuer matters
- Collateralized or uncollateralized

Physically-Backed ETCs:
- Hold actual commodity in storage
- Gold, silver, platinum popular
- Not common for oil/gas (storage costs)
- Lower counterparty risk

Futures-Based ETCs:
- Most oil/gas ETCs use futures
- Roll futures contracts monthly
- Roll yield impact
- No physical storage needed

Synthetic ETCs:
- Use swaps with counterparties
- Issuer hedges with derivatives
- Lower tracking error
- Counterparty risk consideration

ETC vs ETF:

Legal Structure:
- ETC: Debt security
- ETF: Investment fund

Regulation:
- ETCs: Less regulated in some jurisdictions
- ETFs: UCITS regulations in Europe

Tax Treatment:
- May differ by jurisdiction
- Capital gains vs income
- Consult tax advisor

Investor Protection:
- ETFs typically have better protection
- ETCs depend on issuer creditworthiness
- Collateral arrangements important

Popular Oil & Gas ETCs:

WTI Crude Oil ETCs:
- Track front-month WTI futures
- High liquidity
- US benchmark exposure
- Monthly roll costs

Brent Crude ETCs:
- Track Brent futures
- Global benchmark
- European trading hours
- International exposure

Natural Gas ETCs:
- Track Henry Hub futures
- High volatility
- Seasonal patterns
- Weather-sensitive

Refined Products ETCs:
- Gasoline
- Heating Oil
- Less common than crude
- Crack spread plays

Leveraged/Inverse ETCs:
- 2x, 3x long exposure
- -1x, -2x short exposure
- Daily rebalancing
- Decay over time
- For short-term trading only

ETC Mechanics:

Creation/Redemption:
- Authorized participants
- Large block transactions
- Keeps ETC price aligned with NAV
- Arbitrage mechanism

Futures Rolling:
- Monthly contract expiration
- Sell expiring contract
- Buy next month contract
- Roll cost/benefit depends on curve

Roll Yield Example:
```
Contango scenario:
- Sell September contract at $80
- Buy October contract at $82
- Roll cost: -$2 per barrel

Backwardation scenario:
- Sell September contract at $82
- Buy October contract at $80
- Roll gain: +$2 per barrel
```

Management Fees:
- Annual expense ratio (0.3% - 1%)
- Covers administration, storage, insurance
- Reduces returns over time
- Compare fees across products

Costs of ETC Investing:

Explicit Costs:
- Management fees (TER)
- Trading commissions
- Bid-ask spreads
- Currency conversion (if applicable)

Implicit Costs:
- Roll yield (positive or negative)
- Tracking error
- Tax inefficiency
- Rebalancing costs (leveraged ETCs)

Total Cost Example:
```
0.75% Management fee
+/- 5% Roll yield (depending on curve)
0.10% Trading costs
= Net annual cost/benefit
```

Risk Management

Position Sizing:
```
Kelly Criterion:
f = (p * b - q) / b

where:
f = fraction of capital to allocate
p = probability of winning
b = odds received on win
q = probability of losing (1-p)

Conservative: Use 1/4 to 1/2 Kelly
```

Stop Losses:
- Technical: Below support level
- Percentage: -10% to -15%
- Volatility-based: 2 ATR (Average True Range)
- Time-based: Exit after X days if no profit

Volatility Management:
```
Position size = Risk capital / (Price * Volatility)

Example:
$10,000 risk capital
Oil at $80
30-day volatility: 40%

Position = $10,000 / ($80 * 0.40) = 312 barrels
(In ETC shares: Divide by ETC barrel exposure)
```

Hedging Strategies:

Portfolio Hedging:
- Long equity portfolio + Long oil ETC
- Inflation protection
- Crisis scenario hedge
- Reduces overall volatility

Tail Risk Hedging:
