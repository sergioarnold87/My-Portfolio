by Mezzetta (Enterprise Architecture Reference)

=== INTRODUCTION ===
Data Fabric is an architectural approach that provides an integrated layer of data and connecting processes across distributed environments. It enables unified data access, governance, and intelligence across hybrid and multi-cloud landscapes.
