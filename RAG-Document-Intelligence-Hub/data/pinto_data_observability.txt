DATA OBSERVABILITY: MONITORING THE INVISIBLE
by Pinto (Observability Engineering Reference)

=== INTRODUCTION ===
Data Observability is the ability to understand the health and state of data systems through monitoring, alerting, and root cause analysis. Inspired by application observability (logs, metrics, traces), data observability extends these concepts to data pipelines, quality, and lineage.

=== THE THREE PILLARS OF OBSERVABILITY ===

1. METRICS
Quantitative measurements of system health:

Pipeline Metrics:
- Execution time and latency
- Success/failure rates
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Throughput (records/second)
- Queue depth and backpressure

Data Metrics:
- Row counts and volume
- Null rates and completeness
- Distinct value counts
- Statistical distributions
- Schema changes

Business Metrics:
- Data freshness (SLA compliance)
- Cost per pipeline run
- Data product usage
- Business value delivered

2. LOGS
Contextual information about events:

Types of logs:
- Pipeline execution logs
- Data validation results
- Error messages and stack traces
- Audit trails (who accessed what)
- Configuration change logs

Best practices:
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Consistent log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log retention policies

Example structured log:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "pipeline_id": "customer_etl_v2",
  "run_id": "run_20240115_103045",
  "message": "Schema validation failed",
  "error_details": {
    "expected_columns": 15,
    "actual_columns": 14,
    "missing_column": "email_verified"
  },
  "correlation_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

3. TRACES
End-to-end tracking of data flow:

Distributed tracing:
- Track data lineage across systems
- Measure time spent in each stage
- Identify bottlenecks
- Understand dependencies

Trace components:
- Spans: Individual operations
- Parent-child relationships
- Timing information
- Metadata and tags

Benefits:
- Visualize complete data journey
- Performance optimization
- Impact analysis
- Compliance and auditing
