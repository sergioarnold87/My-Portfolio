DATA QUALITY MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT
by Stanley (Quality Engineering Reference)

=== INTRODUCTION ===
Data quality is the foundation of reliable analytics, ML models, and business decisions. Poor data quality costs organizations an average of $12.9 million annually. This guide provides comprehensive strategies for monitoring, measuring, and improving data quality.

=== DATA QUALITY DIMENSIONS ===

1. ACCURACY
Definition: Data correctly represents the real-world entity
Metrics:
- Error rate (% of incorrect values)
- Validation pass rate
- Source reconciliation match rate

Example checks:
- Email format validation
- Phone number pattern matching
- Cross-reference with authoritative sources

2. COMPLETENESS
Definition: All required data is present
Metrics:
- Null rate by column
- Missing record count
- Required field population rate

Example checks:
- Null value percentage < 5% for critical fields
- Row count matches expected volume
- All mandatory attributes populated

3. CONSISTENCY
Definition: Data is uniform across systems and time
Metrics:
- Cross-system match rate
- Format standardization compliance
- Referential integrity violations

Example checks:
- Same customer ID across systems
- Date format consistency (ISO 8601)
- Unit of measure standardization

4. TIMELINESS
Definition: Data is current and available when needed
Metrics:
- Data freshness (time since last update)
- Pipeline SLA compliance
- Lag from source to destination

Example checks:
- Daily data arrives within 2 hours of T+1
- Real-time streams < 5 minute lag
- Update frequency meets requirements

5. VALIDITY
Definition: Data conforms to defined formats and rules
Metrics:
- Schema validation pass rate
- Business rule compliance
- Constraint violation count

Example checks:
- Age between 0 and 120
- Product codes in approved list
- Foreign key constraints satisfied

6. UNIQUENESS
Definition: No unwanted duplication of records
Metrics:
- Duplicate record count
- Primary key uniqueness rate
- Fuzzy match duplicate detection

Example checks:
- One record per customer ID
- Deduplication logic validation
- Duplicate detection algorithms

=== MONITORING ARCHITECTURE ===

LAYER 1: INGESTION QUALITY GATES
Monitor data at entry points:

Checks:
- Schema validation against expected structure
- Row count within expected range
- File format and encoding verification
- Required fields presence

Actions:
- Reject invalid batches
- Alert on anomalies
- Log validation failures
- Quarantine bad data

Implementation:
```
if row_count < expected_min or row_count > expected_max:
    alert("Volume anomaly detected")
    quarantine_file()
if null_rate > threshold:
    reject_batch("Completeness violation")
```

LAYER 2: TRANSFORMATION QUALITY CHECKS
Monitor data during processing:

Checks:
- Pre/post transformation row counts match
- Business logic validation
- Aggregation sanity checks
- Referential integrity

Actions:
- Fail pipeline on critical errors
- Warn on non-critical issues
- Generate quality report
- Update quality metrics

Implementation patterns:
- Assert row count consistency
- Validate calculated fields
- Check distribution shifts
- Monitor transformation performance

LAYER 3: SERVING QUALITY MONITORING
Monitor published data:

Checks:
- SLA compliance (freshness)
- Query performance
- Data drift detection
- User access patterns

Actions:
- Alert on SLA breaches
- Performance optimization
- Refresh stale data
- Usage analytics

LAYER 4: CONTINUOUS QUALITY SCORING
Aggregate quality across dimensions:

Metrics:
- Overall quality score (0-100)
- Dimension-specific scores
- Trend analysis
- Impact assessment

Visualization:
- Quality dashboard by dataset
- Trend charts over time
- Alerting on degradation
- Comparative analysis

=== IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES ===

1. GREAT EXPECTATIONS PATTERN
Modern data quality framework:

Define expectations:
```python
expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("customer_id")
expect_column_values_to_be_between("age", 0, 120)
expect_column_values_to_be_in_set("status", ["active", "inactive"])
expect_table_row_count_to_be_between(1000, 100000)
```

Benefits:
- Declarative quality rules
- Automated documentation
- Version controlled expectations
- Integration with data pipelines

2. STATISTICAL ANOMALY DETECTION
Machine learning for quality monitoring:

Techniques:
- Z-score for outlier detection
- Time series forecasting for volume
- Distribution comparison (KS test)
- Autoencoder for complex patterns

Example:
```python
if abs(zscore(metric_value)) > 3:
    flag_as_anomaly()
if ks_test(current_dist, historical_dist).pvalue < 0.05:
    alert_distribution_shift()
```

Applications:
- Detect subtle quality degradation
- Adapt to seasonal patterns
- Reduce false positives
- Predict quality issues

3. DATA PROFILING AND BASELINING
Establish quality baselines:

Profile metrics:
- Column statistics (min, max, mean, std)
- Distinct value counts
- Null percentages
- Data type distributions
- Pattern analysis

Baseline establishment:
- Run profiling on 30-90 days of data
- Identify normal ranges
- Set dynamic thresholds
- Update baselines periodically

4. RULE-BASED VALIDATION
Business logic enforcement:

Types of rules:
- Single column (range, format, null)
- Cross-column (dependencies, calculations)
- Cross-table (foreign keys, aggregates)
- Temporal (sequence, trends)

Example rules:
- order_date <= ship_date
- sum(line_items) = order_total
- country code exists in reference table
- daily sales within 3σ of 30-day average

5. RECONCILIATION PATTERNS
Verify data movement accuracy:

Source-to-target reconciliation:
- Row count matching
- Checksum validation
- Sample record comparison
- Aggregate value verification

Implementation:
```sql
-- Source count
SELECT COUNT(*) as source_count FROM source_table
WHERE date = '2024-01-15';

-- Target count
SELECT COUNT(*) as target_count FROM target_table
WHERE date = '2024-01-15';

-- Alert if mismatch
IF source_count != target_count THEN
    RAISE ALERT;
```

=== QUALITY METRICS AND KPIS ===

1. DATASET QUALITY SCORE
Formula:
Quality Score = (accuracy_weight * accuracy_score +
                 completeness_weight * completeness_score +
                 validity_weight * validity_score +
                 consistency_weight * consistency_score +
                 timeliness_weight * timeliness_score) / total_weight

Example:
Quality Score = (0.3 * 95 + 0.25 * 98 + 0.2 * 92 + 0.15 * 90 + 0.1 * 88) = 93.35

2. PIPELINE QUALITY KPIs
- Success rate: % of pipeline runs completing successfully
- Data loss: % of records lost in processing
- Quality gate pass rate: % of batches passing validation
- Mean time to detect (MTTD): Average time to detect quality issues
- Mean time to resolve (MTTR): Average time to fix quality issues

3. BUSINESS IMPACT METRICS
- Revenue impacted by data errors
- Decisions delayed due to quality issues
- Customer complaints related to data
- Regulatory findings from data quality

=== ALERTING STRATEGY ===

SEVERITY LEVELS:

- Significant quality degradation
- Partial data unavailability
- Reconciliation failures

Action: Alert within 15 minutes, investigate within 1 hour

Medium (P2):
- Minor quality degradation
- Performance degradation
- Non-critical validation failures

Action: Alert within 4 hours, investigate within 1 day

Low (P3):
- Trends indicating potential future issues
