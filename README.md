## üåé Collaborative Work with South American Stakeholders

Throughout my professional journey, I've collaborated extensively with **South American teams and stakeholders**, including:

- **Agile Methodologies:** Implemented Scrum and Kanban frameworks for iterative development and continuous delivery
- **GitHub Workflows:** Established CI/CD pipelines, code review processes, and branching strategies for distributed teams
- **Asynchronous Communication:** Leveraged tools like Slack, Notion, and Confluence for efficient cross-timezone collaboration
- **Cultural Adaptation:** Worked with teams from Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and other South American countries, adapting to diverse work cultures and communication styles

**Example:** The **Housing Market Analytics** project was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team spanning multiple South American countries, utilizing Agile sprints, GitHub project boards, and daily async standups to deliver a production-ready data warehouse in 4 weeks.

## About this repository

This repository is a personal portfolio containing multiple projects. The top of the repo contains the portfolio landing README (this file). Below we keep project folders and their individual READMEs. Recently we imported an external project "vaca-muerta-observability" into the repository as a new project folder; its README is included below under the "Imported project" section for convenience.

---

## Imported project: Vaca Muerta Data Observability (vaca-muerta-observability)

Below is the imported project's README. It was merged into this repository as a separate project. Please review the project files (folder `vaca-muerta-observability/`) and the project-specific README before using or modifying the code.

# üõ¢Ô∏è Vaca Muerta Data Observability & HF Optimization

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11-blue) ![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-1.28-red) ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Ready-blue) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Production-success)

A comprehensive **Data Engineering and Machine Learning platform** for optimizing hydraulic fracturing operations in unconventional oil & gas reservoirs, specifically designed for the **Vaca Muerta** formation in Argentina.

## üéØ Project Overview

This platform provides end-to-end capabilities for:

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create realistic well datasets using SDV (Synthetic Data Vault)
- **Data Observability**: Monitor data quality, freshness, and schema drift
- **Feature Engineering**: Build advanced features for production forecasting
- **Production Forecasting**: ML-powered predictions using CatBoost and XGBoost

---

(Project README continues in the project folder. See `vaca-muerta-observability/README.md` for the full file.)

## üß™ Example Usage

### Generate Synthetic Data

```python
from src.generate_data import SyntheticDataGenerator

# Generate 150 synthetic wells
generator = SyntheticDataGenerator(n_wells=150)
datasets = generator.generate_all()

# Access datasets
reservoir_df = datasets['reservoir']
fracturing_df = datasets['fracturing']
production_df = datasets['production']
master_df = datasets['master']
```

### Run Data Quality Checks

```python
from src.observability import run_quality_checks

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('data/bronze/wells_synth.csv')

# Run checks
results = run_quality_checks(df, date_column='completion_date')

print(f"Quality Score: {results['quality_score']:.1f}%")
print(f"Completeness: {results['completeness']['overall_completeness_pct']:.1f}%")
```

### Train ML Model

```python
from src.ml_pipeline import ProductionMLPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = ProductionMLPipeline(target_column='cum_oil_180_days_m3')

# Train model
metrics = pipeline.train_model(df)

print(f"Test R¬≤: {metrics['test_r2']:.3f}")
print(f"Test RMSE: {metrics['test_rmse']:.1f} m¬≥")

# Get predictions
predictions = pipeline.predict_cum_oil(df)
```

## üî¨ Scientific Background

This project is based on research from:

1. **Morozov et al. (2020)** - "Data-Driven Model for Hydraulic Fracturing Design Optimization"
2. **Pinto & El Khammal (2023)** - "Vaca Muerta Shale Play Technical Analysis"
3. **Petrella (2023)** - "Digital Twin Applications in Unconventional Reservoirs"

### Key Insights

- **Proppant intensity** is the #1 driver of EUR (Estimated Ultimate Recovery)
- **Reservoir quality** (porosity √ó net pay) explains 40% of production variance
- **Completion design** matters more than reservoir properties in ultra-tight formations
